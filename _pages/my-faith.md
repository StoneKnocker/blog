* Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life.
* Where there is a will, there is a way.
* Today is the youngest day of the rest of your life.
* Take action & focus & show your work.
* The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago, the second best time is now.
* When you desire to own something, consider what the cost is. Are you willing to pay that price?
