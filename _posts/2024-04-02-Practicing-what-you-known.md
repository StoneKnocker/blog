This article is a practical application of the strategies discussed in the previous article. A few days ago, I created a pull request for Shopware to fix a bug.

In the process of practicing, I have gained a better understanding of my current abilities and have become familiar with the workflows used on GitHub.

Shopware's development process is different from the development processes in China, with a strong emphasis on testing and writing development logs. While it may seem less efficient, the emphasis on testing and logging means that the end product is of exceptional quality. It's a slow and steady approach, with a focus on quality, and the end result is worth the wait.

My ideal work environment is using Linux, rather than Windows or macOS, but it seems unlikely that this will be possible in China, as most office software is not compatible with Linux, and there is no web version. So, I'll just consider this as a secondary product for working in Europe.

The PR was declined, and I realized that I need to delve deeper into Shopware to fix the issue. I've been focused on CRUD code too much and need to learn more about the framework's design and architecture.
