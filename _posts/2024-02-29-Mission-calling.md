Before I met my wife, I lived a lonely life filled with negative emotions and had no aspirations for the future.

After getting married, I worked hard and learned a lot, hoping to create a better future. However, I hit a roadblock in my career after two or three years and didn't know how to proceed.

Last year, my wife became pregnant again, and during her pregnancy, our son had a nose surgery. I blamed the poor air quality in Wuhan for his health issues. I wanted to move to a different location.

At first, I considered Zhuhai, a city in southern China, as my destination. However, after learning about the uncertain future of China and the heavy academic burden of raising children, I decided to adjust my destination to Europe. Germany and the Netherlands are my top choices.

After the birth of my daughter, I now have two children, and my motivation to create a better life for them has doubled. My mission is to help my children grow up in a better environment, in a more open society, by moving to Europe.

Therefore, my priority is to learn English and prepare for interviews to make my dream a reality.
