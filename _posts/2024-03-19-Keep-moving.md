Long-termism is easy to talk about, but difficult to put into practice. It requires perseverance over a long period of time, without any immediate feedback or results. This can be challenging for humans, who are accustomed to receiving instant gratification and feedback.

When faced with such challenges, I remind myself of my original intentions and the small achievements I've made so far. This helps to motivate me and keep me going.

Sometimes, I can't help but wonder if my dreams are too big, if I'm too old to achieve them. But the phrase "never too old to learn" has become more than just a saying for me. It's a reminder that age is not a limiting factor when it comes to pursuing my goals.

Maintaining the current status is something I am unwilling to accept. Not making a choice is a form of choice, and it's an easy choice. Don't forget "easy choice, hard life".
