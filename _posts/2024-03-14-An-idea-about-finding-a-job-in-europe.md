I recently read a tweet from someone:
How to get a job:
1.show you want to get the job
2.show you can do the job

In Europe, open-source communities are more active than in China, and many companies open-source their code. This is a great resource for learning and contributing to projects. By participating in the development process, you can familiarize yourself with the work styles of European engineers and gain valuable experience.

Once my English skills improve, make me take conversation fluently with other software engineers, I'll try applying for jobs at companies that have open-source projects. The experience you gain from contributing to open-source projects is essentially 'show you can do the job'.
