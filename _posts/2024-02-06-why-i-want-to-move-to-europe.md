Becaming a father of two, has chagned me a lot.

A few years ago, I knew some people move to Europe and worked in countries like Germany, Netherland, Sweden etc. I didn't have the same motivation as the did. Living in China is nice.

But last year, my son had nose sugeryï¼Œwhich made me hate the horiible air condtion in Wuhan.

What really hurt me was that, kids at primary school have so many homework to do, occupy ther time for having fun. I want my kids have more fun in their childhood, rather than homework.

On the Internet, Chinese content has only 2% market share, we should look at the bigger world, rather than comforting ourselves with our history.

Say back to myself, if I lost my current job, I can't get another like this In China. Programmer's 35 year problem, actually exists.

Overall, I wan't to move to Europe, for the sake of my children's growth, for my work carrer too.
