I've been practicing juggling with three balls lately, and I've found that it's actually not as difficult as I thought it would be. At first, it seemed like a challenge, but after watching some helpful videos online and putting in a few hours of practice, I've finally got the hang of it.

Here's what I've learned:
1. Find a good teaching video online. There are plenty of great resources on YouTube.
2. Pay attention to your posture. It's important to have good posture when juggling.
3. Start with just one ball and get comfortable with it.
4. Once you're comfortable with one ball, move on to two balls.
5. Break down the movement for juggling three balls and gradually increase the number of throws and catches.
6. After you've mastered the previous steps, you'll have the hang of juggling.

It's important to remember not to practice for too long at once. Instead, try practicing for just 15 minutes every day. Consistency is key when it comes to learning a new skill.

And as a bonus, learning new skills in English can help me improve my language skills at the same time. That's a great way to kill two birds with one stone!
