My vocabulary test result is still 5800. To cover 90% of scenarios, it needs to be increased to 7800. After completing the onging word memorization from the vocabulary book, I will start memorizing based on word ratings, from 5 starts to 1 start, prioritizing based on word frequency.

Recently, I have been listening to podcasts like:
Code Newbie
Indie Hacker podcast

There are still many times when I don't understand. Thanks to technological advancements, speeach-to-text technology has become very mature. Windows and chrome already have built-in live caption functionality, and even smartphones support it. While listening to podcats, I can turn on live caption and glance at the subtitles when I don't understand.
